## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Questions and answer choices are pre-defined in an array of objects.
2. When the quiz starts, the first question is dynamically displayed with choices.
3. The user selects an answer; immediate feedback is shown:
   - Correct answer: highlighted in green
   - Wrong answer: selected option turns red and correct answer turns green
4. After answering, the user can move to the next question.
5. The final score is displayed at the end with an option to replay.
