## ✅ Key Features

- **Add New Tasks**  
  Easily input and add tasks to your to-do list with a single click.

- **Mark Tasks as Completed**  
  Toggle tasks to mark them as completed. A visual line-through effect is applied for clear indication.

- **Delete Tasks**  
  Remove tasks instantly using the close (☓) button beside each entry.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  The application uses `localStorage` to save your task list automatically — even after refreshing or closing the browser.

- **Responsive & Intuitive UI**  
  Designed with a visually appealing layout and intuitive interactions that adapt to different screen sizes.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User adds a task** via the input field and presses the "Add" button.
2. **Each task is rendered** as a list item with a delete icon.
3. Clicking a task **marks it as complete** (toggled via class).
4. Clicking the delete icon **removes the task** from the DOM.
5. All changes are **saved in localStorage** to maintain the session.
6. On page load, previously saved tasks are **retrieved and displayed**.
